        <p>Since 2010 we have been documenting lifecycle events with pictures and video.  We provide our clients with fine portraiture, lifestyle portraits, storybook albums and video presentations that have become cherished family heirlooms to be enjoyed for generations!<br><br>
            Life is full of beautiful moments.  These moments give reason to celebrate and get together with friends and family!  These times should be captured and preserved.  This is what we do best.<br><br>  We offer lifestyle portraits, photography and video coverage for all social events throughout Long Island, as well as the Greater New York City and Tri-State Area.
            <br><br>Everyone carries a camera and anyone can take a picture.  As visual artists, our passion for the creative process allow us to capture life at its best, capturing real moments and creating beautiful imagery!
